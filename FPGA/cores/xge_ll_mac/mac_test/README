This directory contains a simple testbench for debugging the OpenCore LLGMAC.

Save vcd from Vivado hw_manager (chipscope)
write_hw_ila_data -vcd_file <file>

Convert Vivado VCD to mentor compatible file by:

changing "var reg" to "var wire".
clean up signal names by removing path and brackets etc.

patch <file>.vcd patch_file

Split busses by converting to wlf and back to vcd
vcd2wlf <file>.vcd <file>.wlf
wlf2vd <file>.wlf -o <new_file>.vcd

vsim -novopt mac_test -vcdstim <new_file>.vcd

Easy ehh?
