2019.2
* Version 2.1 Revision 20
* added support for BUFG_GT_SYNC for BUFG_GT primitive
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 19
* added support for virtexuplusHBM device for primitives IBUFDSGTE, BUFGCE, BUFGCE_DIV and BUFG_GT
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 18
* added SIM_DEVICE generic map for BUFGCE, BUFGCE_DIV,BUFG_GT
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 17
* added optional port BUFGCE_CLR for BUFGCE_DIV to keep all clocks in phase
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 16
* create constraint file when board interface is used
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 15
* updated to versal devices
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 14
* added an optional input port with a default driver connecting to CEB pin of IBUFDS_GTE5 primitive   
2019.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 13
* Do not propagate empty PHASE from INPUT frequency pins
2018.3
* Version 2.1 Revision 12
* Compute output clock frequency for BUFG_GT and BUFGCE_DIV primitives and update on output pin
* For BUFG_GT, user has to update the C_BUFGCE_DIV parameter to reflect input clock devision factor so that output pin shows the divided clock frequency 

2018.3
* Version 2.1 Revision 11
* Added support for C_BUF_TYPE=BUFGCE_DIV primitive with divider(C_BUFGCE_DIV) customization  

2018.2
* Version 2.1 Revision 9
* Fixed issue with ports in create_clock constraint in the implmentation xdc  

2018.1
* Version 2.1 Revision 8
* Extended parameter C_BUF_TYPE range to include "IOBUF" and also sub type IBUFDSGTE5
* Added a new inout port IOBUF_IO_IO enabled with new C_BUF_TYPE value "IOBUF"
* Extended the enablement of ports IOBUF_IO_T, IOBUF_IO_I, IOBUF_IO_O for C_BUF_TYPE = "IOBUF" as well
* Added ttcl file for conditional hdl expansion for newly added C_BUF_TYPE ranges (IBUFDSGTE5 and IOBUF) for synth and simulation file groups
* Removed existing vhd file from synth/simulation groups 

2016.3
* Version 2.1 Revision 6
* Fixed issue related to parameter propagation
* Changed port type from undef to clock for some of input pins and output pins

2015.4
* Version 2.1 Revision 5
* Adding support for Ultrascale Plus devices(kintexuplus, virtexuplus, zynquplus).
* When block is configured as IBUFDSGTE, for Ultrascale Plus devices, IBUFDS_GTE4 primitive will be generated. 

2015.3
* Version 2.1 Revision 4
* add board support
* add CLK_IN_D interface pin when buf_type is IBUFDS/IBUFDSGTE and buf_size is 1

2015.1
* Version 2.1
* Version update from 2.0 to 2.1.
* Display name updated to 'Utility Buffer'.
* Adding a new output port IBUF_DS_ODIV2 when the block is configured as IBUFDSGTE.

2014.4
* Version 2.0
* Version update from 1.0 to 2.0. Changed the port ordering 
* from (0 to C_SIZE - 1) to (C_SIZE - 1 downto 0)

2014.3
 * Version 1.0
 * Revision upgrade from 3 to 4: Adding device support
 * for Ultrascale devices without modifying customer
 * deliverables for existing devices.
 * Modifying model-parameter C_BUF_TYPE's values.
