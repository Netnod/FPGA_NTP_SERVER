Introduction
============

This directory contains the source code for a NTP/NTP server running
in a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA device on a VC709 reference board or in a
Virtex Ultrascale+ FGPA device on a VCU118 reference board.

This NTP server is used to run the Swedish Distributed Time Service.
More information can be found here:

Look at README.md in the respective target directories for more
information on how to build an FPGA image and for the two FPGA
reference boards.  The VC709 project has the most complete
instructions on how to use it, the VCU118 project lacks documentation
on how to set up the hardware, but is is fairly similar.
